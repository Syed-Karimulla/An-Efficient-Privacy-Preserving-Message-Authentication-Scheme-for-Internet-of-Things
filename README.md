The Internet of Things (IoT) provides a self-establishing network of highly coupled heterogeneous objects, such as smart devices, RFID tags, sensors, etc. It allows devices to simplify the retrieval as well as the exchange of data without human involvement in various applications and has a considerable position in the growth of information technology after the computer science and the Internet. IoT brings a pervasive digital appearance by engaging society and industries, and enables a series of interactions between human to human, human to thing, and more importantly, thing to thing. The development of IoT has led to enormous applications, such as smart home systems (SHSs), intelligent transportation systems, machine learning and big data, etc. The machine-to-machine (M2M) communication among massive numbers of IoT devices will dominate future communication network traffic. The integrity and authenticity of the massive amount of data collected and transmitted by the IoT devices are crucial in some applications such as machine learning and big data analytics. Maliciously injected or modified data can cause biased or wrong decision making and prediction. Therefore, in order to ensure the correctness and accuracy of machine learning and big data analysis, the integrity and authenticity of the collected data must be retained.
